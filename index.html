        <h2>About the Environmental Science Program</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The Environmental Sciences Program at the Asian University for Women (AUW) is an interdisciplinary academic initiative designed to address the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. Rooted in scientific inquiry and sustainability, the program equips students with the knowledge and practical skills needed to understand complex ecological systems, analyze environmental issues, and implement solutions that foster resilience and conservation. In addition to the major, AUW also offers a minor in Environmental Sciences as well as a minor in Chemistry, enabling students from diverse academic backgrounds to integrate environmental and scientific perspectives into their primary fields of study. With a strong emphasis on field-based learning, research, and community engagement, the program prepares a new generation of women leaders to shape environmental policy, climate action, and sustainable development across Asia and beyond.</p>
      <!--About the Green Bangle¬†Project-->
      <section id="greenbangla">
        <h2>About the Green Bangle¬†Project</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The Green Bangle Project is a student-led environmental movement initiated at AUW that aims to empower women through eco-feminist principles while promoting biodiversity conservation and climate resilience.. It is making significant strides in combating climate change and safeguarding coastal communities in Sitakunda Upazila (sub-district), on the outskirts of Chittagong in southeastern Bangladesh. By mobilising the power of women (AUW students and local women of Gulia khali) and leveraging the principles of ecofeminism and ecopreneurship, often dubbed as environmental entrepreneurship, this movement is not only restoring vital ecosystems but empowering marginalised communities through eco-friendly enterprises.
The name ‚ÄúGreen Bangle Movement‚Äù symbolises the strength and resilience of women. South Asian women are often recognised by the presence of bangles on their hands. ‚ÄúGreen Bangle‚Äù highlights the central role of women in this movement, empowering them to protect their communities and the environment by creating a green bangle of mangrove forest in the coastal area of Bangladesh. Students from across 18 countries in Asia collaborate through this platform to address rising sea water level, deforestation, ocean pollution, and soil degradation, while also advancing women's leadership in conservation(https://theclimatewatch.com/green-bangle-movement-empowering-women-protecting-coastal-environment/ )</p>
